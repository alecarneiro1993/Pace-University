        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Like I said in the Home page, my name is Alexandre Carneiro, I'm an exchange student from the Brazil
           Scientific Mobility Program, a governmental sponsored program that
           encourages Brazilian students to study and learn from universities
            from around the world.<br><br>
          I come from Rio de Janeiro, also known as "Cidade Maravilhosa" or "Marvellous City" in English.<br>
          The University I go to is called "Universidade Veiga de Almeida" (Veiga de Almeida University) and my major
          there is Computer Engineering. I was in my 8th term when I decided to take the exchange program. The reason
          for that was to improve my language skills, programming skills and professional career.<br><br>
          In my whole life, I've worked for two different companies as an intern:<br>
          The first one was in an insurance company called "Sulamerica Seguros" in which I was a Software Engineering intern.<br>
          The second was in my father's company which is called "RC Ambiental", an environmental legislation company, where I worked
           as a Web Developer intern.<br><br>
           My hobbies are playing video games, guitar, studying and working out.<br><br>
           Oh! I'm a HUGE fan of the Lord of the Ring's movies! Still have to start reading the books though =/.
