        <h1>Welcome to my Webpage!</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Alexandre Carneiro, I'm an exchange student from the Brazil
           Scientific Mobility Program, a governmental sponsored program that
           encourages Brazilian students to study and learn from universities
            from around the world.
          My goal here is to improve my skills in programming, more specifically
           Front-end/Web Development and become a Web Designer. I love to create
           websites and I've been learning front-end languages to that extent.<br><br>
           Currently, the languages known to me are: HTML5, CSS3(still learning),
           PHP (in progress), JavaScript, JavaWeb and jQuery (a library, but it counts).<br>
         In this class, I expect to learn more about PHP, Git and Node.js and also
         improve my JavaScript skills. Also I know some back-end languages such as:
         Java and C++. Let's not forget about SQL as well, more specifically, mySQL.<br><br>
         Please go through the other pages using the nav menu. This website was built using some
         of the HTML5 tags I've learned in some online courses. I intend to do a lot more so bear with me. =)

          It's worth to mention that I know some Designing skills as well, such as: Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator and
         Mockup softwares (such as Balsamiq). There's a lot more that I can put here, but this is not a resume page, so let's get on with it! :D<br>
         <h2>P.S.: This is a basic website, so I'm not putting too much effort on it... sorry.</h2>
